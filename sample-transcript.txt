Meeting Transcript - Q4 Planning Session
Date: December 15, 2024
Participants: Sarah (CEO), Mike (CTO), Lisa (CFO), John (Head of Sales), Emma (Head of Marketing)

Sarah: Good morning everyone, welcome to our Q4 planning session. We have a lot to cover today, so let's get started. Mike, can you give us an update on the technical roadmap?

Mike: Thanks Sarah. We've made significant progress on the mobile app development. The beta version is 80% complete and we're on track for a January launch. However, we've encountered some challenges with the payment integration system that might push us back by 2-3 weeks.

Lisa: That's concerning. What's the financial impact of this delay?

Mike: We're looking at approximately $50,000 in additional development costs, plus potential revenue impact if we miss the Q1 launch window.

John: From a sales perspective, we've already started pre-selling to our enterprise clients. They're expecting delivery in January, so any delay could affect our Q1 revenue projections.

Emma: Marketing has been building significant buzz around the January launch. We've invested about $25,000 in pre-launch campaigns. If we delay, we'll need to adjust our strategy and potentially increase our marketing budget.

Sarah: This is a critical decision point. Let me summarize the key issues: technical challenges with payment integration, potential $50K cost overrun, risk to Q1 revenue, and $25K in marketing spend that might need adjustment.

Mike: I have a proposal. We could launch a limited version without the payment integration in January, then add the full payment system in February. This would let us meet our launch commitment while we resolve the technical issues.

Lisa: That's a good compromise. We could potentially reduce the cost overrun to around $20K, and we'd maintain our revenue timeline.

John: I can work with that. We can sell the limited version to existing clients and upsell the full version when it's ready.

Emma: Marketing can pivot to emphasize the phased rollout. We can position it as "launching early access" which actually sounds more exclusive.

Sarah: Excellent solution. Let's implement Mike's phased approach. Action items: Mike to finalize the limited version scope by Friday, Lisa to update the budget projections, John to adjust sales messaging, and Emma to revise the marketing campaign. Any other business?

Lisa: Yes, we need to discuss the budget allocation for Q1. We're currently over-allocated in some areas and under-allocated in others.

John: I'd like to request additional budget for the new sales team members we discussed last month.

Emma: And I need to increase the digital advertising budget to support the mobile app launch.

Sarah: Let's table the budget discussion for our next meeting. For now, let's focus on executing the mobile app launch plan. Meeting adjourned.

Action Items:
1. Mike: Finalize limited version scope by Friday
2. Lisa: Update budget projections for phased launch
3. John: Adjust sales messaging for limited version
4. Emma: Revise marketing campaign for phased rollout
5. Schedule follow-up meeting for budget allocation discussion
